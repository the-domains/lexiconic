Monsters under the bed? We're adults now, so we aren't afraid to talk about imaginary things that might frighten us. Or are we? Well, some topics in agile testing may point to dysfunctional organizational practices that are often taboo, off limits or avoided in regular conversations. In this article, I will identify four such topics that need to be discussed and addressed for agile success.

When people ask me for advice on agile testing, they are sometimes surprised when I step back and start with clarifying questions about their general development practices. For me, the topic of agile testing is indistinguishable from good agile engineering practices, so I first need to know a little more about which agile practices teams are doing.
