description: "MIT researchers have created a working hydraulic robot from a single 3D print. Meaning the robot can move right off the printer after its done. No assembly required. The tiny, six-legged robots are out of MIT's CSAIL computer science lab and are made of both liquid and solid parts that are fully functional right after the printing process. The group used a printer from Stratasys - one of the largest 3D printer makers - and it can work with eight different materials at the same time."

MIT researchers have created a working hydraulic robot from a single 3D print. Meaning the robot can move right off the printer after its done. No assembly required. The tiny, six-legged robots are out of MIT's CSAIL computer science lab and are made of both liquid and solid parts that are fully functional right after the printing process. The group used a printer from Stratasys - one of the largest 3D printer makers - and it can work with eight different materials at the same time.
